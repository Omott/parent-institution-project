Introduction

This is my final year project on parent-institution interaction: a web and mobile based application.
The project is aimed to allow institution(s) a case study of Fountain University Osogbo Osun State collaborate and pass information to the parents while avoiding the influence of the student and using improved technology.

This app is proposed to allow sending of student results,attendance, payment balances and important events/notifications.
